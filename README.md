# TempoTrackers - Air Quality Forecasting App

## Project Structure

This is a modular web application for NASA Space Apps Challenge that forecasts air quality by integrating real-time TEMPO data with ground-based measurements and weather data.

### Architecture Overview

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Leaflet.js
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Python for ML pipeline
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Redis
- **Cloud**: AWS/Vercel deployment
- **ML**: scikit-learn/TensorFlow for air quality prediction

### Key Features

- Real-time TEMPO satellite data integration
- Interactive mapping with Leaflet.js
- AI-powered air quality forecasting
- Multi-stakeholder alert system
- Historical trends analysis
- Mobile-responsive design

### Development Phases

1. **Foundation & Setup** - Project structure, basic UI
2. **Data Pipeline & ML** - TEMPO API, weather data, ML models
3. **Core Features** - Mapping, forecasting, alerts
4. **Advanced Features** - Historical analysis, optimization
